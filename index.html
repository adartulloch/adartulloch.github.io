My name is Adar Tulloch, and I'm a student at Oberlin College studying computer science and classical piano. Some of my most recent projects include: creating Affectobot, an emotion AI Zoom plugin to gauge audience attention levels, a Huffman file compression program, and a COVID-tracking website created in the beginning of this summer.
