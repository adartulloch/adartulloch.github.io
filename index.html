<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>My name is Adar Tulloch, and I'm a student at Oberlin College studying computer science and classical piano. Some of my most recent projects include: creating Affectobot, an emotion AI Zoom plugin to gauge audience attention levels, a Huffman file compression program, and a COVID-tracking website created in the beginning of this summer.
I'm currently a software developer at Environmental Dashboard, a really fun company that builds community in the greater Cleveland area by delivering software to spread environmental awareness. I'm also currently working on a small research project with Harvard University's "Try-AI" program. My goal is to build an artificial intelligence tool helpful for people with vision difficulties.
I'm investigating how computer vision can be used to detect construction and scaffolding sites in urban settings, using semantic segmentaion, object detection, and depth estimation. I plan presenting to mentors and mentees on 12/13. 
Feel free to contact me at atulloch@oberlin.edu! This site is currently under construction!</p>
