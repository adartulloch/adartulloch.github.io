<h1>Hi, I'm Adar!</h1>
<p>My name is Adar Tulloch, and I'm currently a sophomore at Oberlin College studying computer science and classical piano with a minor in mathematics.
  I love code and play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBf0E8X5EhQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">piano!</a> Some of my more recent projects include creating AffectoBot, an emotion AI Zoom plugin to gauge audience attention levels in virtual meetings,
  a file compression program, and a website to track the spread of COVID-19 in the USA.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently a software developer at Environmental Dashboard, a great company that builds community in the greater Cleveland area by
delivering software to spread environmental awareness. Check out our website <a href="https://www.environmentaldashboard.org/">here!</a>Â 
I'm also currently working on a small research project with Harvard University's <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/try-ai/about_1?authuser=0">"Try-AI"!</a> program.
I'm investigating how computer vision can be used to detect construction and scaffolding sites in urban settings, so people who are visually impaired or blind
can avoid these areas.
Feel free to contact me at atulloch@oberlin.edu! This site is still under construction :)</p>
