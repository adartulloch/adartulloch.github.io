<h1>Hi, I'm Adar!</h1> <img src="img/website_profile.png" alt="it's me!">
<p>My name is Adar Tulloch, and I'm currently a sophomore at Oberlin College studying computer science and classical piano with a minor in mathematics.
  I love code and play piano! Some of my most recent projects include creating Affectobot, an emotion AI Zoom plugin to gauge audience attention levels, a program to
  compress files using the Huffman compression algorithm, and a website to track the spread of COVID-19 in the USA.

I'm currently a software developer at Environmental Dashboard, a great company that builds community in the greater Cleveland area by
delivering software to spread environmental awareness. Check out our website <a href="https://www.environmentaldashboard.org/">here!</a>Â 
I'm also currently working on a small research project with Harvard University's <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/try-ai/about_1?authuser=0">"Try-AI"!</a> program.
I'm investigating how computer vision can be used to detect construction and scaffolding sites in urban settings, so people who are visually impaired and/or blind
can avoid these areas. I plan presenting to mentors and mentees on 12/13.
Feel free to contact me at atulloch@oberlin.edu! This site is still under construction!</p>
